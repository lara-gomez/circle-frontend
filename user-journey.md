# User Journey and Screen Recording

## User Journey

Our user is a recently graduated college student who has just moved to Redmond, WA for their first full-time job, having relocated from Boston, MA where they knew no one in their new city. After struggling to find events that truly matched their interests through traditional methods, they discover Circle and quickly sign up through the streamlined authentication process. They begin by setting up their Profile page, adding their personal interests and hobbies to help the system understand their preferences. On the Discovery page, they see events recommended based on their interests, with each event card clearly showing the organizer's username and event details along with friends who are also interested in going. When they find events that catch their attention, they mark them as interested rather than just browsing, which helps Circle provide better personalized recommendations over time. As they become more engaged with the platform, they start creating their own events through the Manage Events page, organizing activities that align with their interests and sharing them with the community. After attending events (both ones they created and ones they marked as interested), they can review them on the Event History page, where all their past attended events are organized chronologically with their reviews attached, creating a comprehensive record of their event participation. The Manage Events page also serves as their central hub, showing both events they've created and events they're interested in, giving them complete visibility into their event involvement. Through this process of discovering, creating, attending, and reviewing events, our user gradually builds a sense of community and belonging in their new city, with Circle serving as their primary tool for finding and organizing meaningful social activities that align with their interests.
